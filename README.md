jQuery Subordinate
==================

`$.subordinate()` is a combination of [`$.append()`](http://api.jquery.com/append/) and [`$.find()`](http://api.jquery.com/find/).

It appends an element but returns this new created jQuery object.
That makes your code way much shorter and cleaner, when building complex DOM structures on-the-fly.
